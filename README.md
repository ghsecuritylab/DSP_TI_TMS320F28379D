# Lab 1: Dual-Core Debug with F28379D on LAUNCHXL-F28379D

### Key words: IPC (Inter-Processor Communications)

### A typical F28379D application consists of two separate and completely independent CCS projects. One project is for CPU1, and the other project is for CPU2. A project contains all the files needed to develop an executable output file (.out) which can be run on the F28379D device. In lab 1 exercise, we have CPU1 blink LED D10 and the CPU2 blink LED D9.

### The code is this lab will be running from internal RAM.

### CPU1 -> GPIO31 -> LED D10 blinks at 1Hz
### CPU2 -> GPIO34 -> LED D9 blinks at 2Hz
